Project "Tiny GIF"
------------------

This is a WIP project to decode "tiny gifs" (not really gifs anymore)
on a limited-SRAM AVR.

Format specs:
- up to 256-color palette
- palette stored as RGB565
- max 1023x1023 size
- max 10 bit LZW codes
- can be configured for decode with 256 to 4096 bytes of SRAM in 256b increments
(- no big headers, extensions or any of the other weird things gif has)

Usage:
# you need giflib headers for the encoder ("convert")
$ make
# look at Makefile if you have issues. It's short enough :P
$ ./convert ~/your.gif tiny.bin
# you can test that it is decodable w/testdec (and enjoy a horrible ASCII rendition of it)
$ ./testdec tiny.bin
# but really i expect you to include tdgif_lib.h and tdgif_lib.c in/from your MCU project, etc.
